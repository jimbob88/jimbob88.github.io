                    <p>A mixture of anhydrous sodium carbonate and sodium hydrogencarbonate of mass 10.000g was heated
                        until it reached a constant mass of 8.708g. Calculate the composition of the mixture in grams of
                        each component. Sodium hydrogencarbonate thermally decomposes to form sodium carbonate.</p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, let's convert these names of compounds to their chemical formulas:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        $$
                        \begin{gather}
                        \text{Anhydrous Sodium Carbonate: } \ce{Na2CO3} \\
                        \text{Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate: } \ce{NaHCO3}
                        \end{gather}
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, let's look at the other information given to us. We are told that the \(\ce{NaHCO3}\)
                        decomposes to form \(\ce{Na2CO3}\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's write a balanced equation for this:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        $$
                        \begin{gather}
                        \ce{NaHCO3 -> Na2CO3 + H2} \\
                        \therefore \\
                        \ce{2NaHCO3 -> Na2CO3 + H2 + CO2}
                        \end{gather}
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now let's talk about something important with decomposition reactions: The \(\ce{H2} +
                        \ce{CO2}\) are both gases. Let's rewrite this formula:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        $$
                        \ce{2NaHCO3 -> Na2CO3 + H2_{(g)} + CO2_{(g)}}
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This explains why the system has lost mass! Let's calculate how much mass we have lost:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        $$
                        10g - 8.708g = 1.292g
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This means, the \(\ce{H2} + \ce{CO2}\) are of mass 1.292g.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You may think we can now say that the \(\ce{Na2CO3}\) has mass 8.708g but we can't, because we
                        don't know what percentage of the original mixture was anhydrous sodium carbonate (one of the
                        reactants).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What we can do though, is imagine the two gaseous products as "one compound". Let's say that the
                        \(\ce{H2} + \ce{CO2}\) are in one system of \(\ce{H2CO2}\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Calculate the moles of \(\ce{H2CO2}\):
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        $$
                        \begin{gather}
                        \text{moles} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{M}_\text{r}} \\\\
                        \text{moles} = \frac{1.292g}{18+12+(16 \times 2)} \\
                        \text{moles} \approx 0.020677 mol
                        \end{gather}
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Calculate the molar ratio of \(\ce{H2CO2}\):\(\ce{NaHCO3}\).
                        From the formula, we can see it is 1:2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        $$
                        \begin{gather}
                        \therefore \text{mol}(\ce{NaHCO3}) = 2 \times \text{mol}(\ce{H2CO2}) \\
                        \text{mol}(\ce{NaHCO3}) \approx 0.041355
                        \end{gather}
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can now calculate the mass of \(\ce{NaHCO3}\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        $$
                        \begin{gather}
                        \text{mol} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{M}_\text{r}} \\
                        \text{mol} \times \text{M}_\text{r} = \text{mass} \\
                        \text{M}_\text{r}(\ce{NaHCO3}) = 23+1+12+(16 \times 3) \\
                        \text{mass} \approx \text{M}_\text{r}(\ce{NaHCO3}) \times 0.041355 \\
                        \text{mass} \approx 84 \times 0.041355 \\
                        \text{mass} \approx 3.5g \\
                        \end{gather}
                        $$
