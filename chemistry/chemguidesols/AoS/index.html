              A mixture of anhydrous sodium carbonate and sodium
              hydrogencarbonate of mass 10.000g was heated until it reached a
              constant mass of 8.708g. Calculate the composition of the mixture
              in grams of each component. Sodium hydrogencarbonate thermally
              decomposes to form sodium carbonate.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, let's convert these names of compounds to their
              chemical formulas:
            </p>
            <p>
              $$ \begin{gather} \text{Anhydrous Sodium Carbonate: } \ce{Na2CO3}
              \\ \text{Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate: } \ce{NaHCO3} \end{gather} $$
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, let's look at the other information given to us. We are told
              that the \(\ce{NaHCO3}\) decomposes to form \(\ce{Na2CO3}\).
            </p>
            <p>Let's write a balanced equation for this:</p>
            <p>
              $$ \begin{gather} \ce{NaHCO3 -> Na2CO3 + H2} \\ \therefore \\
              \ce{2NaHCO3 -> Na2CO3 + H2 + CO2} \end{gather} $$
            </p>
            <p>
              Now let's talk about something important with decomposition
              reactions: The \(\ce{H2} + \ce{CO2}\) are both gases. Let's
              rewrite this formula:
            </p>
            <p>$$ \ce{2NaHCO3 -> Na2CO3 + H2_{(g)} + CO2_{(g)}} $$</p>
            <p>
              This explains why the system has lost mass! Let's calculate how
              much mass we have lost:
            </p>
            <p>$$ 10g - 8.708g = 1.292g $$</p>
            <p>This means, the \(\ce{H2} + \ce{CO2}\) are of mass 1.292g.</p>
            <p>
              You may think we can now say that the \(\ce{Na2CO3}\) has mass
              8.708g but we can't, because we don't know what percentage of the
              original mixture was anhydrous sodium carbonate (one of the
              reactants).
            </p>
            <p>
              What we can do though, is imagine the two gaseous products as "one
              compound". Let's say that the \(\ce{H2} + \ce{CO2}\) are in one
              system of \(\ce{H2CO2}\).
            </p>
            <p>Calculate the moles of \(\ce{H2CO2}\):</p>
            <p>
              $$ \begin{gather} \text{moles} =
              \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{M}_\text{r}} \\\\ \text{moles} =
              \frac{1.292g}{18+12+(16 \times 2)} \\ \text{moles} \approx
              0.020677 mol \end{gather} $$
            </p>
            <p>
              Calculate the molar ratio of \(\ce{H2CO2}\):\(\ce{NaHCO3}\). From
              the formula, we can see it is 1:2.
            </p>
            <p>
              $$ \begin{gather} \therefore \text{mol}(\ce{NaHCO3}) = 2 \times
              \text{mol}(\ce{H2CO2}) \\ \text{mol}(\ce{NaHCO3}) \approx 0.041355
              \end{gather} $$
            </p>
            <p>We can now calculate the mass of \(\ce{NaHCO3}\).</p>
            <p>
              $$ \begin{gather} \text{mol} =
              \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{M}_\text{r}} \\ \text{mol} \times
              \text{M}_\text{r} = \text{mass} \\ \text{M}_\text{r}(\ce{NaHCO3})
              = 23+1+12+(16 \times 3) \\ \text{mass} \approx
              \text{M}_\text{r}(\ce{NaHCO3}) \times 0.041355 \\ \text{mass}
              \approx 84 \times 0.041355 \\ \text{mass} \approx 3.5g \\
              \end{gather} $$
            </p>

            <p>
              A mixture of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate with a mass
              of 10.000g was heated to constant mass, with final mass being
              5.096g.
            </p>
            <p>
             Firstly, we will form the two decomposition reactions: 
            </p>
            <p>
            $$
            \begin{gather}
            \ce{MgCO3 -> MgO + CO2} \\ 
            \ce{CaCO3 -> CaO + CO2}
            \end{gather}
            $$
            </p>
            <p>
            The next step, is to realise that we have no idea how many moles of each carbonate we have! The formulas we just wrote assume we have 1 mol of each. That means we should form a new set of equations using \(x\) and \(y\):
            </p>
            <p>
            $$
            \begin{gather}
            x\ce{MgCO3 ->} x\ce{MgO} + x\ce{CO2} \\
            y\ce{CaCO3 ->} y\ce{CaO} + y\ce{CO2}
            \end{gather}
            $$
            </p>
            <p>
            Now let's join all of these together to make one huge formula, keeping this algebraic terms:
            </p>
            <p>
            $$
            x\ce{MgCO3} + y\ce{CaCO3 ->} x\ce{MgO} + y\ce{CaO} + x\ce{CO2} + y\ce{CO2} 
            $$
            </p>
            <p>
            Now let's go back to the question from before ad note down what the masses of these are!
            </p>
            <p>
            We are told the mass of Calcium Carbonate and Magnesium Carbonate sums to 10.000g. <br/>
            We are told the mass of the end product is 5.096g. Because \(CO2\) is a gas, we know that it has left the system. \(\therefore\) the Oxides sum to give 5.096g. <br/>
            Leaving 4.904g for the CO2.
            </p>
            <p>
            Using this, we can form a set of simultaneous equations:
            </p>
            <p>
            $$
            \begin{gather}
            x\ce{CO2} + y\ce{CO2} = 4.904 \\ 
            y\ce{MgO} + y\ce{CaO} = 5.096
            \end{gather}
            $$
            </p>
            <p>
            We can then substitute the \(M_r\) of these compounds to form mathematical equations:
            </p>
            <p>
            $$
            \begin{gather}
            (12+32)x + (12+32)y = 4.904 \\
            (24.3+16)x + (40.1+16)y = 5.096
            \end{gather}
            $$
            </p>
            <p>
            Solving on a calculator gives:
            </p>
            <p>
            $$
            \begin{gather}
            x \approx 0.0732 \\
            y \approx 0.0382
            \end{gather}
            $$
            </p>
            <p>
            Now that we have the moles of \(\ce{MgCO3}\) (\(x\)) , we can calculate the mass of it, by first calculating the \(M_r\)
            </p>
            <p>
            $$
            \begin{gather}
            \text{M}_\text{r}(MgCO3) = 24.3+12+16+16+16 = 84.3 \\
            84.3 \times x = 6.17076 \\
            \frac{6.17076}{10} \times 100 \approx 61.7\%
            \end{gather}
            $$
