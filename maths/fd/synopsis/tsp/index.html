    <h1>The Travelling Salesman Problem</h1>
    <h2>
        What is it?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Let's say you want to visit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIsPZqdyyG8">all the cities</a> in England,
        what is the shortest way of travelling to all the cities?
    </p>

    <h2>The Graph Theory Definition</h2>
    <p><dfn><abbr>TSP</abbr> (The Travelling Salesman Problem)</dfn>:
        An algorithm used to find the shortest cycle that visits every vertex in a network before returning to the
        starting node.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that this is <i><b>different</b></i> from the Route Inspection / Chinese Postman
        problem, because route inspection is used to find the shortest way of visiting all the arcs/edges, <b>not</b>
        the nodes (like in the TSP).
    </p>

    <h2>The two types of problem</h2>
    <p>
        There are two types of problem: The Classical & The Practical.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <dfn>Classical</dfn>:
            Each vertex must be visited <mark>exactly</mark> once before returning to the starting node.
        </li>
        <li>
            <dfn>Practical</dfn>:
            Each vertex must be visited <mark>at least</mark> once before returning to the starting node.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In order to make both of these problems the same, we need to construct <b>a complete network of least
            distances</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <dfn>A complete network of least distances</dfn>:
        A graph, often represented as a table, that shows the shortest distance between every node<sup><a
                href="#note1">1</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        You will do this by inspection, so there is no need to use Floyd's Algorithm to solve this in your exam.
    </p>

    <h2>The Algorithm</h2>
    <p>
        Something that it is key to understand, is that there is <b>no</b> perfect algorithm that'll solve this problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        Instead, what we are going to do, is find a Lower Bound and an Upper Bound. You should remember these terms from
        GCSE and your frequency tables. You would have a class like: 13 &le; x &lt; 25. That would have a lower bound of
        13, and an upper bound of 25. So we know that the value of x could be anything in between these two numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <dfn>Upper Bound</dfn>:
        The biggest number a variable could take
    </p>
    <p>
        <dfn>Lower Bound</dfn>:
        The smallest number a variable could take
    </p>
    <p>
        What we need to find is the Lowest <i>Upper Bound</i> and the highest <i>Lower Bound</i>. You might be confused
        by this, but what we are trying to do is close in on the smallest number of possible values. Let's say for 13
        &le; x &lt; 25. There are 12 values it could take. So, if we wanted to guess what value x was, it would be a "1
        in 12" chance. But if we were to have the bounds: 20 &le; x &lt; 22, we only have 2 values it could be, so we
        have a "1 in 2" chance of guessing it.
    </p>

    <h2>The Upper Bound</h2>
    <p>
        There are two methods to find an upper bound:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Minimum Spanning Tree Method
        </li>
        <li>
            The Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <dfn><abbr>MST</abbr> (Minimum Spanning Tree)</dfn>: A subgraph that has no cycles and contains every vertex
    </p>

    <h3>The MST Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Use Krushkal's or Prim's Algorithm to find the MST
        </li>
        <li>
            Double the arcs
        </li>
        <li>
            Seek shortcuts
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Nearest Neighbour Algorithm<sup><a href="note2">2</a></sup></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Select a starting node</li>
        <li>Choose the smallest arc that is connected to a node that hasn't been visited yet</li>
        <li>From that node, and only that node, select an arc</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This algorithm is virtually the same as Prim's algorithm, but in Prim's you always look back at every Arc you
        have visited in the past, whereas in NN you only focus on the node you are currently visiting.</p>

    <h2>The Lowest Bound</h2>
    <p>There is one algorithm for the Lowest Bound and it has a very fancy name:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The Lowest Bound Algorithm
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This algorithm is all about finding a Residual Minimum Spanning Tree</p>
    <p>
        <dfn><abbr>RMST</abbr> (Residual Minimum Spanning Tree)</dfn>: An MST of a subgraph with one vertex missing
    </p>
    <h3>The Lowest Bound Algorithm</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Choose a starting node, note down its two smallest arcs
        </li>
        <li>
            Delete said node from the graph and all its arcs
        </li>
        <li>
            Find the MST from this new subgraph
        </li>
        <li>
            Add back the starting node, with only the two shortest nodes
        </li>
    </ol>

        <i>A quick note:</i> This is not intended to teach you, it is instead intended to be a quick refresher to make
        sure you understand what you are doing. I needed to write these so that I had a database of ways to
        differentiate between the different types of problem.
