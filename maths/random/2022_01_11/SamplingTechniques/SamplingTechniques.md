# Sampling Techniques

### Types of sampling technique

#### Random

- Systematic Sampling

- Simple Random Sampling

- Stratified Sampling

#### Non-random

- Quota Sampling

- Opportunity Sampling

### Definitions & Examples

#### Systematic Sampling

Systematic sampling is where you start at a random position in a list, and then take every $n^{th} \text{ term}$ and create a sample of the population this way.

For example:

\[
\text{The full population is 20 people, the following list shows them:}
\\
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
\\
\text{Pick a random number to start on:}
\\
3
\\
\text{Select every 5th number after this:}
[3, 8, 13, 18]
\]

Note: The sampling frame is usually randomised to decrease bias (grouping people alphabetically could cause issues where certain members of the population are over or under-represented)

#### Simple Random Sampling

Given a list of numbers, you just randomly select a sample of them. I.E., generate 10 random numbers on a calculator, and then pick these people.

#### Stratified Sampling

Stratified Sampling is where you take the population and split them into different groups. You then take these groups and proportionally sample based off their numbers.

For example:

$\text{The full population is 100 people. There are 60 women, and 40 men.}
\\\therefore 
\text{60\% women and 40\% men}
\\
\text{You are then told that you must do a sample of 50 of these people}
\\
\therefore 60\% \times 50 = 30, 40\% \times 50 = 20
\\
\text{You then take a simple random sample from these numbers}$

#### Quota Sampling

Quota Sampling is where the population is divided into groups of characteristics (specifically selected by the researcher). For example, before a researcher starts, they may decide that they want to interview $30\%$ women and $70\%$ men. The researcher then interviews people and assesses their group, this continues until each quota has been filled. If someone refuses to be interviewed, one can just move on!

#### Opportunity Sampling

A good example of this is when someone waits outside a shop and picks a random person to interview whenever someone steps outside the door, it doesn't matter if the person refuses to be interviewed, because you can just wait for the next person!

#### Advantages & Disadvantages

#### Systematic Sampling

| Advantages                                       | Disadvantages                                             |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple and quick to use                          | A sampling frame is required                              |
| Suitable for large samples and large populations | It can introduce bias if the sampling frame is not random |

#### Simple Random Sampling

| Advantages                                                          | Disadvantages                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Free of bias                                                        | Not suitable when the population or sample size is too large |
| Easy and cheap to implement for small populations and small samples | A sampling frame is required                                 |
| Each sampling unit has a known and equal chance of selection        |                                                              |

#### Stratified Sampling

| Advantages                                                           | Disadvantages                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sample accurately emulates the population structure                  | The random selection within each strata suffers from the same issues as Simple Random Sampling |
| Guarantees proportional representation of groups within a population | Population must be clearly classified into distinct groups                                     |

#### Quota Sampling

| Advantages                                                                 | Disadvantages                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Small samples can still be representative of a whole population            | Non-random sampling can introduce bias                                      |
| Simple, quick & cheap                                                      | Groups might be inaccurate                                                  |
| Allows a researcher to make comparisons between the groups of a population | Increasing the scope of a study drastically increases the cost of the study |
| No sampling frame                                                          | Non-responses give no meaningful data                                       |

#### Opportunity Sampling

| Advantages        | Disadvantages                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Easy to carry out | Dependent on the individual researcher |
| Cheap             | Most likely won't be representative    |
