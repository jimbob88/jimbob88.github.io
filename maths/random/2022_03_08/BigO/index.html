    <h1>Big O Notation</h1>
    <p>
        Big O notation is probably something you have come across if you have ever done programming or looked at
        mathematical algorithms. Many algorithms (i.e. Ramujan's Formula) list a Big O notation, examples of these
        notations are:
        $$
        \Large
        \begin{multline}
        \\
        O(1) \\
        O(n) \\
        O(n^2) \\
        O(n \log(n)) \\ \\
        \end{multline}
        $$
        But what do these things <i>actually</i> mean?
    </p>
    <h3>
        A measure of speed
    </h3>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, Big O notation can be treated as the "speed" of the algorithm. But this term isn't entirely
        correct, it should instead be seen as "how much an increase in difficulty, increase time".
    </p>
    <h2>Programming Examples</h2>
    <p>
        Now that statement might not instantly make sense, but stick with me here, using these coding examples, I hope
        to help you understand.
    </p>
    <h3>\(O(1)\) Complexity</h3>
    <pre>
    <code class="language-python">
def get_item(l, n):
    return l[n]

x = [0, 1, 2, 3]
get_item(x, 2)
    </code>
    
</pre>
    <p>
        We call the algorithm <i>get_item</i> difficulty: \( O(1) \). This is because, even if the list is 10000s of
        items long, the difficulty of accessing the "nth" term is no more complicated. I.e. finding item 1 and finding
        item 10000 are equally as difficult.
