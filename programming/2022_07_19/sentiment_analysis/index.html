    <title>Sentiment Analysis Questions</title>

<body>
    <h1>Things to consider before using sentiment analysis</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>How do you handle irony?</li>
        <li>What is the age group you are surveying? (Different datasets are targeted at different age groups)</li>
        <li>What slang words will the dataset not understand? And on the flip-side what technical language may be
            confused?
            <ul>
                <li>Do certain slang terms mean different things in different countries? (e.g. "fag" in Britain means
                    cigarette, but in America can be used as a derogatory term for homosexuals) </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>What are the differences in culture between those who are being surveyed? (i.e. certain colours may have
            different connotations in different areas)</li>
        <li>How will you deal with compound sentences? (i.e. "This problem was making me so angry, thanks for fixing
            it")</li>
        <li>How will it cope with emojis?
            <ul>
                <li>How will you cope with differences in culture? &#128591; can mean prayer in Western, Christian
                    societies but simply high-five in others.</li>
                <li>Might some emojis get confused based on your age group? &#128128; can be used ironically by younger
                    people but quite literally for those of an older generation</li>
                <li>Do you trust the emoji labels given by companies? &#x1F625; is labelled as "DISAPPOINTED BUT
                    RELIEVED FACE" by <a
                        href="https://www.quackit.com/character_sets/emoji/emoji_v3.0/unicode_emoji_v3.0_characters_all.cfm">quackit.com</a>
                    but it could easily be confused as "disappointed and crying"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            If you are making a training dataset, who are you creating the dataset for? What kind of people do you want
            to target in your survey?
        </li>
        <li>
            Is it ethical to make decisions based off "mined" sentiment? (i.e. from using Twitter or other social media
            platforms)
        </li>
        <li>
            Does tone or content affect sentiment polarity the most?
        </li>
        <li>
            How might your system cope with idioms?
        </li>
        <li>
            How might you deal with spelling errors? It is unlikely a sentiment system will notice that "hapy" is
            "happy"
        </li>
        <li>
            How might it deal with phrases that come down purely to tone of voice? "It's not amazing" can be both used
            as something that is okay/quite good, or can come across as incredibly rude
        </li>
        <li>
            What functions will you apply to your polarity scores? If you read 3.5.1 of <a href="#fr1">[1]</a> you can
            see some techniques you might use
        </li>
        <li>
            At what cut-off point does polarity become positive or negative?
        </li>
        <li>
            What sentences are difficult for simple sentiment analysers to work?
            <ul>
                <li>
                    "He is using you" Negative (marked as neutral, connotation not understood)
                </li>
                <li>
                    "He is using the computer" Neutral
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Sample mean." Neutral (marked as negative because of "mean")
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Would analysing a likert scale make more sense? 
        </li>
    </ul>
