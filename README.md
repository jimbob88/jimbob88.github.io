My personal blog and guide centre!

I have tried to keep the size of the website as low as possible!

### Google

Although I use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) (and use the `key` and `sitemap` to verify this), I do not have any Google Analytics (to the extent of my knowledge) on this site!

### JavaScript

Some areas of this website rely on JavaScript for reliably showing things such as MathJax. I have avoided using this in any of the browsing systems, the only time JavaScript is ever loaded, is on my blog posts or guides themselves!

A list of JavaScript active pages can be seen below:
