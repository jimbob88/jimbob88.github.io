My personal blog and guide centre!

I have tried to keep the size of the website as low as possible!

### Google
Although I use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) (and use the `key` and `sitemap` to verify this), I do not have any Google Analytics (to the extent of my knowledge) on this site! 

### JavaScript
Some areas of this website rely on JavaScript for reliably showing things such as MathJax. I have avoided using this in any of the browsing systems, the only time JavaScript is ever loaded, is on my blog posts or guides themselves!

A list of JavaScript active pages can be seen below:

| Site                                         | URL                                                 | Reason                      |
