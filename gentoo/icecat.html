    <h1>Installing icecat on gentoo</h1>

    <p>
      This guide uses commands surrounded in square brackets "[]", to indicate
      commands that are optional. I.e. if you are the superuser you don't need
      to run the "[sudo]" command. If you are a normal user, just remove the
      square brackets and type "sudo".
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        First of all we need to download a copy of <i>gnuzilla</i>: <br />

        <code>
          git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/<mark>git</mark>/gnuzilla.git
        </code>

        <br />

        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b> I specifically highlighted the fact it says
          <mark>git</mark> here instead of <mark>cgit</mark>, "cgit" is the
          default URL for <i>viewing</i> git not cloning it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For the next stage we will need a couple of packages from emerge:</p>

        <code>
          [sudo] emerge mercurial perl dev-lang/python dev-python/pip
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We will now install jsonschema using pip:</p>

        <code> pip install jsonschema [--user] </code>

        <p>
          <b>NOTE: </b> If you use the [--user] option, then you should add
          <i>$HOME/.local/bin</i> to your path!
          <br />
          If you are using BASH this is pretty easy (bash is the default, so if
          you haven't changed it, this is what you are using! Add to the end of
          the <i>~/.bashrc</i> file:
          <br />
          <code> export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" </code>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We will now open cpan:</p>
        <code> cpan </code>
        <p>
          You should now see a new blinking cursor that says:
          <code>[cpan]&gt;"</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          From here we will install the latest
          <code>/File-Rename/</code> because the gentoo version is rather
          outdated (2022/02/22)!
        </p>
        <code>
          install /File-Rename/ <br />
          exit
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now we will check that we have all the correct dependencies!</p>
        <code>
          cd gnuzilla <br />
          ./makeicecat
        </code>
        <p>
          This should give you some warnings if anything "makeicecat" needs is
          missing (you will be installing more dependencies later down the road)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now that you have ran the above command, we can move to the
          <i>output</i> folder and create a new <i>objdir</i> folder
        </p>
        <code>
          cd ./output <br />
          mkdir objdir <br />
          cd objdir
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you <b>DO NOT</b> have <mark>pulseaudio</mark> installed you will
          need <i>media-libs/libpulse</i> because this will give you some sound
          output (with systemd)! I would recommend you use a full pulseaudio
          install with the <i>USE="pulseaudio"</i> flag (because it gives a lot
          more control and a lot of supported devices).
        </p>
        <code> [sudo] emerge media-libs/libpulse </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now we need to install even more dependencies (using cargo). If you
          <b>DO NOT</b> already have <i>cargo</i> installed you will need rust
        </p>
        <code> [sudo] emerge dev-lang/rust </code>
        <p>When you have rust, you can then install via cargo:</p>
        <code> cargo install cbindgen </code>
        <p>
          If you have not done so already, you will need to add "~/.cargo/bin"
          to your path, this can be done by adding
          <code>export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"</code> to your
          <i>.bashrc</i>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The next install (the installation of clang, which I seem to remember
          took quite a long time, even on my R7 2700x) requires you add a new
          value to your <i>USE</i> flag. If you haven't done this before, don't
          worry it isn't <i>hard</i>. <br />
          First we will open the "/etc/portage/make.conf" file, I will be using
          nano, because it is easy for beginners (if you don't have it
          installed: <code>[sudo] emerge nano</code>
        </p>
        <code> [sudo] nano /etc/portage/make.conf </code>
        <p>
          Now look for the line that says <code>USE="........"</code>. Inside
          the strings, add a space, and type <i>abi_x86_32</i>
        </p>
        <p>For example, my use variable currently reads:</p>
        <code>
          USE="X nvidia postproc <mark>abi_x86_32</mark> pulseaudio openh264
          alsa minizip gtk"
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Install the clang compiler (and make a couple of cups of tea), due to
          how long this takes, you may want to combine this command with the
          next one, so it does it all in one go
        </p>
        <code> [sudo] emerge clang </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now for even more dependencies!</p>
        <code>
          [sudo] emerge net-libs/nodejs app-arch/zip dev-libs/dbus-glib
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Double-check you are in the ./gnuzilla/output/objdir directory. If you
          aren't <i>cd</i> there!
        </p>
        <p>Now for the configuration of icecat</p>
        <code>
          ../icecat-(ver-num)/configure.in
          --with-l10-base=../icecat-(ver-num)/l10n
          --with-libclang-path=/usr/lib/llvm/13/lib64/
        </code>
        <p>
          Replace (ver-num) with the version you are installing, the original
          command I wrote was:
        </p>
        <code>
          ./icecat-91.6.0/configure.in --with-l10n-base=../icecat-91.6.0/l10n
          --with-libclang-path=/usr/lib/llvm/13/lib64/
        </code>
        <p>
          <b>NOTE:</b> This may change with future versions due to changes in
          the <i>llvm</i> directory, if the clang fails, try search your
          <i>/usr/lib/llvm</i> to see if the number has changed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now we'll compile, I have 8 logical processors and 16gb of ram, so
          I'll be sticking to <i>make -j8</i>, if you don't know what you have
          (it'll take a long time) but you can be safe and simple type
          <code>make</code>.
        </p>
        <code> make -j8 </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now for the installation, installation isn't necessary, feel free to
          use it in this build folder if you realy want to!
        </p>

        <code> [sudo] make install </code>
      </li>
    </ol>
