    <h1>Broadcom Wireless Drivers</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! <br />
      Recently I had some trouble getting my BCM4352 working (Asus 802.11ac),
      here is a guide of how I fixed it! <br />
      Personally I use systemd (this is not the default for a lot of gentoo
      systems), some commands/steps may be different on your system, I will
      indicate when something I am doing is specific to systemd! <br />
      This guide requires internet access in parts, either use another computer
      to download these things and copy them over, or use ethernet. If you don't
      have ethernet either, I salute you for continuing to try o7.
    </p>
    <p>This code was written on:</p>
    <code>
      Linux annic-gentoo 5.16.11-gentoo202202251339 #4 SMP PREEMPT Fri Feb 25

      AuthenticAMD GNU/Linux

      As always, square brackets are used to show where commands are optional
      depending on your system

        <h3>Get the drivers</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing I needed to do was make sure I had all the correct
          drivers in my <code>/usr/src/linux/.config</code> file. Luckily, the
          <a
            href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/net-wireless/broadcom-sta"
            >net-wireless/broadcom-sta</a
          >
          package warns you when settings are missing from your kernel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>net-wireless/broadcom-sta</code> package comes with the
          following list of errors:
        </p>
        <code>
          ERROR_B43: B43: If you insist on building this, you must blacklist it!
          <br />
          ERROR_BCMA: BCMA: If you insist on building this, you must blacklist
          it! <br />
          ERROR_SSB: SSB: If you insist on building this, you must blacklist it!
          <br />
          ERROR_MAC80211: MAC80211: If you insist on building this, you must
          blacklist it! <br />
          ERROR_LIB80211: LIB80211: Please enable it. If you can't find it:
          enabling the driver for "Intel PRO/Wireless 2200BG" (IPW2100 or
          IPW2200) should suffice. <br />
          ERROR_PREEMPT_RCU: PREEMPT_RCU: Please do not set the Preemption Model
          to "Preemptible Kernel"; choose something else. <br />
          ERROR_LIB80211_CRYPT_TKIP: LIB80211_CRYPT_TKIP: You will need this for
          WPA. <br />
          ERROR_X86_INTEL_LPSS: X86_INTEL_LPSS: Please disable it. The module
          does not work with it enabled. <br />
        </code>
        <p>
          If you see any of these errors <i>Don't worry, we'll fix them!</i>
        </p>

        <p>Run the following command to install the drivers:</p>
        <code> [sudo] emerge [--ask] net-wireless/broadcom-sta </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Now we are going to debug the errors/warnings you receive</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            <h6>ERROR: B43, BCMA, SSB, MAC80211</h6>
            <p>
              If you don't want to remove these from your kernel (I did this, by
              going through and deselecting each one from my menuconfig), you
              can add the following to your
              <code>/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</code> file:
            </p>
            <code>
              blacklist b43 <br />
              blacklist bcma <br />
              blacklist brcmsmac <br />
              blacklist ssb <br />
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h6>ERROR: LIB80211</h6>
            <p>
              If you have just setup your gentoo kernel, this is the most likely
              error you will see. In order to solve this problem, I'll teach you
              the method of debugging it! <br />
              We can see that the error is something related the Kernel. So what
              we must do is change settings in the kernel! <br />
              Let's go to the kernel configuration!
            </p>
            <code>
              cd /usr/src/linux <br />
              [sudo] make menuconfig
            </code>

            <p>
              Now that we are in the main menu, we can press the
              <code>/</code> (slash) key. You'll see a search box appear on your
              screen. Let's type <i>LIB80211</i> and press enter. You should get
              a result like this:
            </p>
            <code>

            <p>
              The symbol highlighted in blue will be different on your system
              (it'll be [=n]). <br />
              The highlighted (yellow) line will have a key difference in your
              setup, not all the letters in brackets will be [=m] or [=y], you
              need this row to have [=y] or [=m] (ignore the other rows for
              now). <br />
              For me, the ones that were disabled [=n] were
              <i>WLAN_VENDOR_INTERSIL</i> and <i>HOSTAP</i>. <br />
              Press ENTER to exit, and do another search with the
              <code>/</code> (slash) key. This time we will search for the value
              which wasn't activated (e.g. WLAN_VENDER_INTERSIL).<br />
              Searching for WLAN_VENDOR_INTERSIL results in the following:
            </p>
            <code>
              Main menu <br />
              &emsp;-&gt; Device Drivers <br />
              &emsp;&emsp;-&gt; Network device support (NETDEVICES [=y]) <br />
              &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;-&gt; Wireless LAN (WLAN [=y]) <br />
            </code>
            <p>
              Follow this route from the main menu (press enter to exit your
              search). For me, I ended up in the "Wireless LAN section",
              scrolled down to "Intersil Devices" and pressed space on it to
              enable it (include it). A new sub-menu appeared, oh look the Host
              AP option is there! That's convenient, I pressed [m] on this to
              modularize it!
            </p>
            <p>
              If you now press <code>/</code> (slash) and search again for
              LIB80211, you should see that highlighted row is now full of [=y]
              or [=m]. Perfect! You have successfully enable LIB80211 (in your
              config file, you haven't installed it yet, use the right-arrow key
              to go and save it to a <i>.config</i> file! We'll compile the
              kernel later!)

            <p>
              We will follow the same process as the previous step (2.b.) to
              solve this problem. Press <code>/</code> (slash) and search for
              LIB80211_CRYPT_TKIP
            </p>
            <code>

              You should notice that the requirements of this is the exact same

        <h3>Compile the linux kernel</h3>
        <p>
          I assume you know what you are doing here, you should be following
          your own method for compiling, if you have never done this before, I
          thoroughly recommend reading this first:

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          For completeness, I will be posting the commands I ran here (these may
          not work on your system....)
        </p>
        <code>
          $ sudo make -j16 <br />
          $ sudo make modules_install <br />
          $ sudo make install <br />
          $ sudo dracut --kver=5.16.11-gentoo <br />
          $ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg <br />

        <h3>Use an old version of wpa_supplicant</h3>
        <p>
          After a long time of getting annoyed with the way iwd works (on my
          system it was <i>NOT</i> stable, I can't say why, and this isn't
          really meant to diss the work that went into creating it, I use it on
          my laptop and it is 1000x better than wpa_supplicant, but for some
          unknown reason it just doesn't work that well on my computer). <br />
          Now for some bad news, the latest versions of wpa_supplicant (2.10 and
          2.9 as of 2022) don't work well with broadcom-sta.
          <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1703745"

          Even though redhat have marked this issue as closed, people have still
          been having problems from 2019-04-28 to this day. Some of the fixes
          noted might be interested to read if you really need the features of
          wpa_supplicant-2.9+ (or are worried about the security issues related
          to using old versions of software). A couple of these are related to
          NetworkManager (I don't use this), if you use it, it's definitely
          worth a read! <br />
          In order to fix this, I used an old version of wpa_supplicant.
        </p>
        <code>
          mkdir ~/compile <br />
          cd compile <br />
          wget https://w1.fi/releases/wpa_supplicant-2.8.tar.gz <br />
          tar -xvf wpa_supplicant-2.8.tar.gz <br />
          cd wpa_supplicant-2.8
        </code>
        <p>
          Now we need to configure our supplicant, open
          <code>./wpa_supplicant/.config</code> in your favourite editor, and
          write this:
        </p>
        <code>

          A handy reference for writing this file can be found on the
          <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Wpa_supplicant">Gentoo wiki</a>.
          Personally, I'll show you my configuration, because it may just work
          on your system (if you are connecting to a WPA Wireless Access Point)
        </p>
        <p>
          Edit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf (you need superuser

        <h3>Configure <mark style="background-color: red">Systemd</mark></h3>
        <p>The rest of this guide is for systemd users <b>ONLY</b></p>
        <p>
          The installation we did for our wpa_supplicant did not include a
          systemd service, so we will make our own! This code is versatile, so
          should work even if you have a non-standard wireless device (like
          wlan0 vs wlp6s0)
        </p>
        <p>
          Create a new file:
          <code>/etc/systemd/system/network-wireless@.service</code> and type
          the following in it:
        </p>
        <code>
          [Unit] <br />
          Description=Wireless network connectivity (%i) <br />
          Wants=network.target <br />
          Before=network.target <br />
          BindsTo=sys-subsystem-net-devices-%i.device <br />
          After=sys-subsystem-net-devices-%i.device <br />
          <br />
          [Service] <br />
          Type=oneshot <br />
          RemainAfterExit=yes <br />
          TimeoutSec=30 <br />
          Killmode=process <br />

          ExecStart=/bin/ip link set dev %i up <br />
          ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/wpa_supplicant
          -c/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf -i %i -B <br />
          <br />
          ExecStop=/bin/ip link set dev %i down <br />
          <br />
          [Install] <br />
          WantedBy=multi-user.target <br />
        </code>
        <p>
          Feel free to change the TimeoutSec variable, I set it at such a low
          value, so if anything breaks, I don't have to wait indefinitely after
          each reboot (and then use a livecd to rescue my system)
        </p>
        <p>
          If this doesn't work for you, double check the location of the ip
          binary (by typing <code>whereis ip</code>) and the installation
          location of wpa_supplicant (by typing
          <code>whereis wpa_supplicant</code>) and substitute the /bin/ip with
          your systems location.
        </p>
        <p>
        Now we need to choose which Wireless device we are going to use, type <code>ifconfig</code> to see what name your wireless card has (clue: they normally start with a w, i.e. wlan0, wlp6s0, wlp3s0). Take this name and substitute the correct value in to the following command:
        </p>
        <code>
            [sudo] ln -s /etc/systemd/system/network-wireless@.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/network-wireless@<mark>wlp6s0</mark>.service
        </code>
        <p>
        Now enable wpa_supplicant
        </p>
        <code>
            [sudo] systemctl enable network-wireless@<mark>wlp6s0</mark>
        </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Reboot</h3>
      </li>
    </ol>
